HYBRID CLOUD INTEGRATION MADE EASY

mmesh is a hybrid cloud integration platform that lets you create your own virtual private architecture independent from the underlying infrastructure.

mmesh has been designed to be simple, enjoyable and easy-to-use and allows you to integrate your legacy and multi-cloud infrastructure in minutes.

You won't need to hire experts to build and manage advanced hybrid cloud solutions with mmesh.

mmesh has been created as an all-in-one solution and integrates a next-gen cloud networking engine with a systems management, automation and monitoring platform.

With mmesh you can unify the way you manage your network, security policies and automation workflows for your on-prem and multi-cloud infrastructure.

The founders of mmesh are former IBMers with many years of experience in designing and managing large enterprise infrastructure solutions, so you can expect this platform will also meet the requirements of many large organizations and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) interested in reducing costs of infrastructure and operations.

➝ Kubernetes & More: Improve security and save money with mmesh

With mmesh you can seamlessly integrate your Kubernetes applications with other cloud or legacy infrastructure into a unified virtual private topology without adding a single line of code or configuration.

mmesh connects your Kubernetes Pods and ClusterIP services directly to your private network, so you can save hundreds of dollars in cloud load-balancers and public IPs while you make your infrastructure more secure.

➝ Next-Gen Cloud Networking and Advanced Security

mmesh builds an encrypted overlay on top of your infrastructure and lets you design your architecture using logical tenants, networks and subnets.

With mmesh you are automatically enforcing end-to-end encryption over QUIC streams for your applications, so you can easily move internal applications to the public cloud securely, without having to expose them to the Internet to make them reachable from your internal network.

You can connect on-prem servers, laptops, Kubernetes apps, cloud VMs from different providers... to your mmesh, and make them visible on the same logical subnet or not according to your own criteria, no matter where they are.

➝ Enhance your DevOps

mmesh monitors your nodes out-of-the-box without any specific configuration and includes an alert system that you can integrate with Slack and PagerDuty.

The mmesh platform also includes an automation engine and scheduler for your infrastructure. You only need to create your mmesh workflows to take advantage of it. They are YAML files with jobs you want to automate.

With mmesh, you can even implement advanced service management flows by including reviewers and approvers in your mmesh workflows. This feature is designed for organizations and Managed Service Providers (MSPs) that need to implement service management controls in their operations.

Additionally, with the GitHub integration, you can implement GitOps flows to manage your mmesh workflows and simplify your DevOps toolchains.

INTEGRATIONS

➝ GitHub

With mmesh, you can organize your network security policies and automation workflows in your private GitHub repos.

And once you enable the GitHub integration in your mmesh account, you'll be able to implement advanced GitOps or DevSecOps flows to manage your network security and trigger actions on your nodes with git-push events.

➝ PagerDuty

You can integrate the mmesh alert system with your PagerDuty account.

➝ ClickUp

With the ClickUp integration, you can have all the information from mmesh directly on ClickUp integrated views: nodes, workflows, network status, monitoring events, alerts...

➝ Slack

With the Slack integration, you can receive notifications, alerts and workflow reports from mmesh via Slack.

➝ Webhooks

You can enable a webhook trigger in your mmesh workflows. This will allow you to automate operations on your nodes directly from your external monitoring system or CI/CD.

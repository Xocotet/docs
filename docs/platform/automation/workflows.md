# Workflows

The automation subsystem of mmesh is based on `workflows`.

They are declarative YAML files where you define the jobs or processes you want to automate, the triggers and schedule configuration to launch them, the target nodes and other parameters like notification recipients and reviewers/approvers.

You can easily manage your mmesh workflows via GitOps by enabling the GitHub integration.

## Triggers

- GitHub push events
- Webhooks
- Schedules

## Jobs

[TBD]

## Notifications

[TBD]

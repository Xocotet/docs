# Overview

Welcome to the mmesh documentation.

mmesh is an all-in-one, hybrid cloud integration platform that allows you to work seamlessly with on-prem and multi-cloud infrastructure.

mmesh builds an abstraction layer on top of the underlying infrastructure, letting you design your own virtual topology to standardize how you work with your cloud and traditional infrastructure.

This documentation is a reference for all features of mmesh.
